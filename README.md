# Unrefine
Ruby 2.0 introduces "Refinements". No one knows what problem they solve or how
they work. This gem removes them. Probably.

## How to use
    gem install unrefine  
  
    require 'unrefine'

## Apology
I don't understand what "Refinements" do, nor what they are supposed to do.
For this reason, and because I am very very lazy, I have not been able to 
write any tests for this gem. I guarantee that some things will be different
after requiring this gem, but make no further claims about its value.
